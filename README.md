# simple-bytcode-vm

A simple bytecode compiler + VM for a Clojure - inspired lisp, written in Clojure.

Inspired by [this brilliant post](https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/bytecode-interpreters/).

## Usage

### Compile a file

    $ lein -compile examples/fact.lisp

### Run a compiled bytecode file

    $ lein -run examples/fact.lisp.edn 5

### REPL

    $ rlwrap lein -repl

## Future work

- JIT
- AOT bytecode -> native compiler
